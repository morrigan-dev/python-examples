and the letter as arguments."

https://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods
You might want to experiment with some of them to make sure you understand how they work. 
strip and replace are particularly useful.

The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing. For example, in find(sub[, start[, end]]), 
the brackets indicate optional arguments. So sub is required, but start is optional, and if you include start, 
then end is optional."""
